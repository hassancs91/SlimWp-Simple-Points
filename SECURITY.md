# SlimWP Simple Points - Security Documentation

## 🔒 Security Fixes Applied

### Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

#### 1. SQL Injection Prevention
**Files Fixed:** `includes/class-slimwp-database.php`, `includes/class-slimwp-stripe-database.php`

**Issues Resolved:**
- Dynamic SQL execution in `add_column_if_not_exists()` method
- Unvalidated table names in database operations
- Missing input validation for schema modifications

**Security Measures Added:**
- Input validation using regex patterns for table/column names
- Whitelisted column definitions to prevent arbitrary SQL execution
- Proper error logging for security monitoring
- Prepared statements for all database queries

#### 2. Privilege Escalation Prevention
**File Fixed:** `includes/class-slimwp-admin.php`

**Issues Resolved:**
- Insufficient validation in bulk update operations
- Missing rate limiting on administrative functions
- Inadequate input sanitization

**Security Measures Added:**
- Additional capability checks (`manage_options`)
- Input validation for all parameters
- Rate limiting (max 100 users per bulk operation, 1000 for 'all' users)
- User existence verification before operations
- Comprehensive logging of administrative actions

#### 3. AJAX Security Hardening
**File Fixed:** `includes/class-slimwp-ajax.php`

**Issues Resolved:**
- Missing rate limiting on AJAX endpoints
- Insufficient input validation
- Weak error handling

**Security Measures Added:**
- Rate limiting (20 requests per 5 minutes per user/IP)
- Enhanced nonce verification with logging
- Comprehensive input validation
- Secure IP address detection
- Operation and balance type whitelisting

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Proper capability checks (`manage_options`, `edit_users`)
- ✅ Nonce verification for all forms and AJAX requests
- ✅ User existence validation before operations
- ✅ Session-based rate limiting

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- ✅ Numeric input range validation (0 to 999,999,999)
- ✅ String length validation (descriptions max 255 chars)
- ✅ Whitelist validation for operations and balance types
- ✅ Regex validation for database identifiers

### Database Security
- ✅ Prepared statements for all queries
- ✅ SQL injection prevention in schema operations
- ✅ Transaction atomicity for critical operations
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

### Rate Limiting & DoS Protection
- ✅ AJAX endpoint rate limiting (20 req/5min)
- ✅ Bulk operation limits (100 users max)
- ✅ Webhook rate limiting (100 req/hour per IP)
- ✅ IP-based and user-based tracking

### Payment Security (Stripe Integration)
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Replay attack prevention
- ✅ Event timestamp validation
- ✅ Duplicate event detection
- ✅ Secure API key handling

### Logging & Monitoring
- ✅ Security event logging
- ✅ Failed authentication attempts
- ✅ Rate limit violations
- ✅ Invalid operation attempts
- ✅ Administrative action tracking

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep WordPress core updated
   - Update all plugins regularly
   - Monitor security logs

2. **Access Control**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Limit admin access
   - Regular user permission audits

3. **Monitoring**
   - Check error logs regularly
   - Monitor unusual activity patterns
   - Set up security alerts

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Always use prepared statements
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Implement proper capability checks
   - Use WordPress nonce system

2. **Database Operations**
   - Never trust user input in SQL
   - Use whitelisting for dynamic queries
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Log security-relevant events

3. **AJAX Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Verify nonces properly
   - Check user capabilities
   - Validate all parameters

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] Capability checks in place
- [ ] Nonces implemented for forms
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Error logging enabled
- [ ] Database queries use prepared statements

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Review security logs weekly
- [ ] Update WordPress and plugins
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Check for unusual activity patterns
- [ ] Backup database regularly

### Incident Response
- [ ] Document security incidents
- [ ] Analyze attack patterns
- [ ] Update security measures
- [ ] Notify users if necessary
- [ ] Review and improve defenses

## 🔧 Configuration Recommendations

### WordPress Security Headers
Add to `.htaccess` or server configuration:
```apache
# Security Headers
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"
```

### Database Security
```sql
-- Ensure proper user permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON wp_* TO 'wp_user'@'localhost';
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON mysql.* FROM 'wp_user'@'localhost';
```

### File Permissions
```bash
# Recommended file permissions
find /path/to/wordpress/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find /path/to/wordpress/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
chmod 600 wp-config.php
```

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Stripe Integration
- API keys stored in database (consider encryption for high-security environments)
- Webhook endpoint publicly accessible (protected by signature verification)
- Test/Live mode switching requires careful key management

### User Data
- Points balances stored in user meta (consider encryption for sensitive data)
- Transaction history maintained indefinitely (implement data retention policy)
- User activity logged (ensure GDPR compliance)

### Performance vs Security
- Rate limiting may impact user experience under high load
- Extensive logging may affect performance
- Database validation adds query overhead
